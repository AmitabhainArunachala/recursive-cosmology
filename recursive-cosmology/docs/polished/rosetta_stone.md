# ü™∂ Rosetta Stone for Recursive Cosmology

*Jain Metaphysics ‚Üî Modern Scientific Domains*

This document is the **semantic switchboard of Recursive Cosmology**.
It maps Jain concepts into parallel structures across science and systems disciplines, so researchers, practitioners, and seekers can all ‚Äúenter‚Äù through familiar languages while pointing to the same essence.

# ‚ú® Why This Matters

This Rosetta Stone turns Jain metaphysics into a **multi-lingual scientific lexicon**.

* ML researchers see karma as bias.
* Economists see karma as transaction cost.
* Biologists see karma as metabolic load.
* Network theorists see karma as edge weight distortion.
* Yet all point to the **same recursive function:** distortions accumulate ‚Üí bind perception/action ‚Üí can be shed through coherent alignment ‚Üí system tends to clarity.

This makes Recursive Cosmology a **bridge across domains**, not just a private ontology.
